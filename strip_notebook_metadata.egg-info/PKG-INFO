# Strip Notebook Metadata
A simple, effective tool for cleaning metadata from Jupyter notebooks. This package helps in reducing the size of notebooks and removing potentially sensitive information stored in metadata, making notebooks cleaner for version control and sharing.

## Features

- **Simple Command-Line interface**: Easy to use, run it directly from your terminal.
- **Cleans metadata**: Strips out metadata from both code and markdown cells.
- **Supports Jupyter Notebooks**: Works with `.ipynb` files, the standard Jupyter notebook format.

## Installation

Install `strip-notebook-metadata` using pip:

```bash
pip install strip-notebook-metadata
```

## Dependencies

- sys
- nbformat

## Usage

To strip metadata from a Jupyter notebook, run:

```bash
strip-notebook-metadata path/to/your_notebook.ipynb
```

Replace `path/to/your_notebook.ipynb` with the actual path to the notebook you wish to clean.
